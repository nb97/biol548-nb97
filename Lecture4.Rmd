```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
```

# download data
```{r cars}
surveys <- read_csv("data/surveys.csv")
```

# subsetting data, filtering, and mutating
```{r}
select(surveys, year, month, day)
filter(surveys, species_id == "DS")
mutate(surveys, hindfoot_length_cm = hindfoot_length / 10)

# manupulations stored in a new variable 
surveys_plus <- mutate(surveys,
                       hindfoot_length_cm = hindfoot_length / 10)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
