Function basics
```{r}
#this won't do anything
function_name <- function(inputs) {
  output_value <- do_something(inputs)
  return(output_value)
}

#creating a function wont run it
calc_shrub_vol <- function(length, width, height) {
  volume <- length * width * height
  return(volume)
}

#call on arguments 
calc_shrub_vol(0.8, 1.6, 2.0)
# and store 
shrub_vol <- calc_shrub_vol(0.8, 1.6, 2.0)
```


## Exercise 1
Write a function that converts pounds to grams (there are 453.592 grams in one pound). It should take a value in pounds as the input and return the equivalent value in grams (i.e., the number of pounds times 453.592). Use that function to calculate how many grams there are in 3.75 pounds.
```{r}
pound_to_gram <- function(pound) {
  weight_g <- pound * 453.592
  return(weight_g)
}

pound_to_gram(3.75)
```


```{r}

```
